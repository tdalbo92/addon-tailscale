# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Tailscale

This is a temporary fork until the upstream repo can merge the latest Tailscale version.  

See https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-tailscale/pull/122

## About

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.
